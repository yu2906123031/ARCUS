# Get current server time

> Returns the current server wall-clock time as Unix nanoseconds. Rate-limited to 1 token per call.

<Note>**The response body shown here is a static example, not live data.** After you click **Send**, your live result appears in a separate panel headed **200 OK**. The panel under the status-code tabs is a fixed sample from the spec — its field values (fees, prices, sizes, IDs, timestamps) are placeholders. Use **Send**, or call the endpoint, for current values.</Note>

Returns the current server wall-clock time as Unix nanoseconds. Rate-limited to 1 token per call.


## OpenAPI

````yaml /api-reference/openapi.yml get /v1/time
openapi: 3.1.0
info:
  title: Arcus API
  version: 1.0.0
  description: >
    REST API for the Arcus exchange. Provides endpoints for order management,
    market data, and account onboarding.


    ## Authentication

    Order management and credential-creating endpoints require **three** request
    headers:


    - `X-API-Key` — hex-encoded Ed25519 public key (64 chars). The public key
    *is* the API key. Obtain/register one via `POST /createApiKey`.

    - `X-Timestamp` — Unix time in **nanoseconds** as a decimal string (e.g.
    `"1713825891591000000"`). Millisecond or second epochs are rejected with
    `401 Unauthorized`. Must be within ±30,000 ms of server wall-clock;
    otherwise the request is rejected with `401 Unauthorized`.

    - `X-Signature` — lowercase hex-encoded Ed25519 signature (128 chars).


    **Single-order endpoints** (`placeOrder`, `cancelOrder`, `modifyOrder`) use
    the **ordersign typed canonical payload** as the signing message — a
    compact, key-sorted JSON object with engine-native integer values. The
    payload is NOT the raw HTTP body; it is built from the parsed request
    fields:

      ```
      placeOrder:   {"ad":"0x…","ai":N,[,"c":"…"],"ct":N,"g":N,"m":N,"op":1,"p":N,"q":N,"r":0|1,"s":N,"t":N,"v":1}
      cancelOrder:  {"ad":"0x…","ai":N,[,"c":"…"],"ct":N,[,"id":"…"],"m":N,"op":2,"v":1}
      modifyOrder:  {"ad":"0x…","ai":N,[,"c":"…"],"ct":N,"g":N,[,"id":"…"],"m":N,"op":3,"p":N,"q":N,"r":0|1,"s":N,"t":N,"v":1}   (exactly one of id / c)
      ```

    `ct` in the payload must equal `X-Timestamp`. Integer values `p`, `q` etc.
    are engine-native ticks/quantums, not human-readable decimals. Keys in
    brackets are conditional (omitted when empty). `op` is the operation enum:
    `1`=place, `2`=cancel, `3`=modify, `4`=placeUntriggered (TPSL). See the
    signing reference below for the full field definitions and reference signing
    code.


    **Batch endpoints still require this header to be present** (its value is
    not verified) — see below.

    - **Batch endpoints are signed per order, but the `X-Signature` header must
    still be present.** `POST /batchPlaceOrders`, `POST /batchCancelOrders`, and
    `POST /batchModifyOrders` require `X-API-Key` + `X-Timestamp` +
    `X-Signature`; the gateway does **not** verify the envelope `X-Signature`
    *value* for these routes (set it to any one element's signature), but
    omitting it — or sending an empty value — rejects every element with
    `invalid order signature`. Instead, each element of the `orders` / `cancels`
    / `modifies` array embeds its own `"signature"` field — a 128-hex Ed25519
    signature over the **ordersign typed canonical payload** for that operation:

        - Plain `orders` elements (no `tpsl_type`) use `op=1`.
        - TPSL / conditional `orders` elements (with `tpsl_type`) use `op=4`
          (`OpPlaceUntriggered`) — same field set as `op=1` but a different `op` value,
          preventing replay of a TPSL signature as a plain placeOrder.
        - `cancels` elements use `op=2`.
        - `modifies` elements use `op=3` — the same payload as a standalone `modifyOrder`.

    The `ct` field inside every element's payload must equal the shared
    `X-Timestamp` header value. The whole batch consumes a single replay slot.


    Read-only endpoints (`GET /openOrders`, `GET /fills`, etc.) require only
    `X-API-Key`. In relaxed local development the gateway may run with
    signatures disabled; the OpenAPI `security` blocks list `signedRequest` (the
    three-header AND) or `{}` (empty) to reflect that.


    ## Account-scoped requests

    Public account info reads such as fills, positions, orders, open orders, and
    account snapshots require `address` as a **query parameter**. Signed order
    management requests also require `address`, and it must match the master
    Ethereum address returned for that API key from `POST /createApiKey`.
    WebSocket `placeOrder` / `cancel` / `batchPlaceOrders` / `batchCancelOrders`
    / `modifyOrder` / `batchModifyOrders` use the same value in the JSON payload
    field `address`.


    ## Order execution is asynchronous

    `POST /placeOrder`, `POST /cancelOrder`, `POST /batchPlaceOrders`, `POST
    /batchCancelOrders`, and `POST /batchModifyOrders` are asynchronous. They
    return either:


    - **`202 Accepted`** — the common case. The signed request was validated by
    the gateway and forwarded to the matching engine; the body does **not**
    carry the order's terminal state.

    - **`200 OK`** — returned only when the gateway already has definitive state
    for the request by the time it responds (the body's `status` reflects that
    state, e.g. `OPEN` / `FILLED` / `CANCELED` / `REJECTED`). Clients should
    treat this as best-effort enrichment and not rely on it.


    In both cases the body echoes `orderId` / `clientId` so callers can
    correlate WebSocket events with the request. To observe the full order
    lifecycle (`OPEN`, `FILLED`, `CANCELED`, `REJECTED`, fills, rejection
    reasons, etc.) clients **must** subscribe to the `orders` WebSocket channel
    (and `userFills` for trade-level events). Treat both the `202` and `200`
    HTTP bodies as request acknowledgements; all definitive state lives on the
    WebSocket.


    ## Order rejection reasons

    When the matching engine rejects an order, the resulting `AccountUpdate`
    event (delivered over the WebSocket `account` channel with `type: REJECTED`)
    carries a `rejectionReason` enum. The same value may also appear on HTTP
    `OrderResponse` / `CancelOrderResponse` bodies that resolved to definitive
    state before returning (the `200` path described above). The complete set of
    reasons the matching engine can emit today is:


    | Value                        |
    Meaning                                                                 |

    |------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|

    | `POST_ONLY_WOULD_CROSS`      | Post-only order was rejected because it
    would have crossed the book and taken liquidity. |

    | `SELF_TRADE`                 | Order would have matched against another
    resting order belonging to the same account; self-trade prevention rejected
    it. |

    | `UNDERCOLLATERALIZED`        | Account has insufficient free collateral /
    margin to support the order. |

    | `COULD_NOT_FILL`             | Generic "could not fill" outcome. Legacy
    reason — prefer the IOC/FOK-specific values below for time-in-force-driven
    cancels. |

    | `IOC_CANCELED`               | An `IMMEDIATE_OR_CANCEL` order produced
    zero fills against the book and was canceled. |

    | `FOK_FAILED`                 | A `FILL_OR_KILL` order could not be filled
    in full at submission and was canceled in its entirety. |

    | `REDUCE_ONLY_WOULD_INCREASE` | A `reduceOnly` order was rejected because
    executing it would have opened or increased the account's position rather
    than reducing it. |

    | `TOO_MANY_CLIENT_IDS`        | Account already has 10,000 live `clientId`s
    (the per-account maximum). Cancel an existing order or wait for one to reach
    a terminal state to free a slot. |

    | `DUPLICATE_CLIENT_ID`        | The `clientId` already maps to a live order
    on this account. Cancel the prior order (or change it in place via
    `modifyOrder`) before reusing the same `clientId`. |


    See the `RejectionReason` schema for the canonical enum.


    ## Rate limiting

    Rate-limited endpoints return `429 Too Many Requests` carrying two
    retry-after signals:


    - `Retry-After` HTTP header (integer seconds, RFC 7231 compliant).

    - `retryAfterMs` field in the JSON body — precise milliseconds.


    The body also carries a typed `reason` indicating which layer rejected
    (`ip`, `account_empty`, `account_partial`). See `RateLimitedError` for the
    schema and `TooManyRequests` for the behavioral contract.

      Signed order management endpoints (all are HTTP `POST`). Every request

      `X-Signature` where `X-Signature` is an Ed25519 signature over the
      operation-specific signing message: `placeOrder`, `cancelOrder`, and
      `modifyOrder` sign the ordersign typed canonical payload (the JSON object
      itself, no prefix), while `cancelAllOrders` and `setLeverage` use the
      legacy `X-Timestamp + ACTION + canonicalJSON(body)` message (ACTION = the
      final camelCase path segment; the HTTP method is not signed).
      `X-Timestamp` is a Unix nanosecond epoch (decimal string) and must be
      within ±30,000 ms of server wall-clock. See the top-level
      **Authentication** section for full details. These endpoints also require
      query parameter `address` matching the key's master Ethereum address.

      Affiliate / referral program endpoints. Mutating endpoints (`POST`)
      require the full Ed25519 signature triple and the body `address` must

      Most read endpoints (`GET`) are signed too, and `?address=` must match the
      API key's master Ethereum address — so a caller only ever reads their own
      referral data. That covers `/info`, `/code`, `/referees` and
      `/commissions`.


      Still public and scoped by `?address=`: `/myReferrer` (returns the
      binding's code and discount, never the referrer's address), `/claims`,
      `/claimStatus`, `/codeAvailable` (returns only whether a code is taken,
      never its owner) and `/leaderboard`.

        values may be added in future versions, so clients should treat unknown
        values as opaque.

        - `retryAfterMs` — precise milliseconds the client should wait before
        retrying. The HTTP `Retry-After` header carries the same information
        rounded up to whole seconds (RFC 7231); prefer this field when

    TooManyRequests:
      description: >
        Rate limit exceeded. Two signals are returned, designed to coexist with
        both naive HTTP clients and rate-limit-aware SDK clients:


        - `Retry-After` header (integer seconds, RFC 7231 compliant). Rounds up
        — clients that obey this header sleep at least as long as required. Safe
        for generic HTTP libraries to read.

        - JSON body `retryAfterMs` (precise milliseconds, matches the server's
        internal computation). Sophisticated clients should prefer this over the
        header to avoid the round-up overshoot.

        - JSON body `reason` indicates which rate-limit layer rejected: `ip`
        (per-IP weight bucket), `account_empty` (per-subaccount pool fully
        exhausted, in drip throttle), `account_partial` (pool has some credit
        but not enough for this batch — split the request smaller to drain), or
        `unknown` (defensive fallback).

        - JSON body `clientId` (single-order endpoints) or `clientIds` (batch
        endpoints) echoes the request's client-supplied order identifier(s) so
        the client can correlate the rejection to a specific order request.
